# Day 11 Cosmic Expansion
Come across an observatory. The elf is a researcher studying with a giant
telescope. Need to help him  with the observation analysis.

## Part 1
The researcher has data in a giant image.  The image includes empty space (.)
and galaxies (#)

The researcher is trying to figure out the sum of the lengths of the shortest
path between every pair of galaxies

Catch: the universe  expanded in the time it took the light from those galaxies
to reach the observatory

Only some space expands.  Any rows or columns that contain no galaxies should be
twice as big.

Need to calculate the sum of the shortest paths between all pairs or N choose 2
options.

### Notes
Basically the shortest path is just the coordinate difference. i.e. sounds more
complicated but is simple
